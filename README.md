PS3EYE Driver
========

Some driver like routines to connect and work with Sony PS3 EYE Camera

> The driver code is in C because we have to deal with USB stuff and to manage
> it across platforms I decided to use [libusb](https://github.com/libusbx/libusbx)
> Most of the code was ported from Linux kernel source.

> You can find example code for [Cinder](https://github.com/cinder/Cinder) and [openFrameworks](https://github.com/openframeworks/openFrameworks) in corresponding folders
